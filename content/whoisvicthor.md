Hey there!

My name is *Victhor Sartório*. I was born in *Vila Velha in Espírito Santo, Brazil* ("Old Village" in Portuguese - current pop. 500k, small town 😬), though I currently live in Rio de Janeiro 🏞

I'm pretty inconsistent as far as my hobbies go! Currently *learning the piano*, trying out *writing* as a hobby, super into *note-taking*, enjoying being *bad at chess*, like to *program* random stuff and surprisingly into exercising so far this year 🏋️ 

I currently work as a *staff data scientist* at the Brazilian gaming unicorn [Wildlife Studios](https://wildlifestudios.com/), mostly working on Real-Time Bidding for advertising, but also playing with different stuff here and there. Most of my time is spent trying to tackle complicated challenges with cool and very talented people, so it's been a fun ride for the past 2 years here!

If you want to talk or hear more about me, feel free to reach out; my e-mail is victhor `at` this domain.
