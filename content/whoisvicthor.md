Hey there!

My name is *Victhor Sart√≥rio*. I was born in *Vila Velha in Esp√≠rito Santo, Brazil* ("Old Village" in Portuguese - current pop. 500k), though I currently live in Rio de Janeiro üèû

I'm *vegetarian*. I'm having fun *learning the piano*. I enjoy *being bad at chess* and going to the *beach*. I'm putting effort into *note-taking*. I enjoy *writing*, which is why I decided to create this blog. I also like most things related to *data and technology*.

I currently work as a *data scientist* at the Brazilian gaming unicorn [Wildlife Studios](https://wildlifestudios.com/), working with Demand-Side Real Time Bidding for mobile advertising. I'm super happy building complex systems with challenging requirements with a bunch of fun, caring, and brilliant people.

If you want to talk or hear more about me, feel free to reach out; my e-mail is victhor `at` this domain.
