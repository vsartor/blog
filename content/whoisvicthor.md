Hey there!

My name is *Victhor SartÃ³rio*. I was born in a *Brazilian coastal city called Vila Velha* ("Old Village" in Portuguese - current pop. 500k), though I currently live in beautiful *Rio de Janeiro*.

I wanted to write more and expose some of my thoughts to the world, so I created this blog! While I may be biased towards specific topics, there is no exact intended theme for this website.

I'm *vegan*, recently developed an obsession with *note-taking*, love *going to the beach*, and like most things related to *technology and data*, besides dabbling with other interests now and then :)

As for my career:

I work as a *data scientist* but I like to play with software development on my side projects. Although I started programming quite a few years before college, I eventually decided to study *Statistics at the National School of Statistical Sciences* for my undergrad and followed that up with an *MSc in Statistics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro*. I really like stats ðŸ¤“

After my MSc, I dropped my plans to follow an academic career and joined the technology branch of the Brazilian media conglomerate: *Globo.com*. There I worked in the Big Data department as a Data Scientist developing machine learning products for advertising, helping the company increase the value of its broadcast and digital advertising portfolio.

I now work at the Brazilian mobile gaming unicorn *Wildlife Studios*, still working with digital advertising, currently focused on using data science to optimize real-time bidding. I'm super happy to be taking on some tough challenges with the help of some brilliant people.

If you want to talk or hear more, feel free to reach out to me! My e-mail is victhor `at` this domain.
