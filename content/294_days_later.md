I created this blog on October 23<sup>rd</sup> 2022. Even since I only posted *once*, and it was [a bad post](@{base_url}/posts/bad_post.html) (it was about how I didn't post anything, which I just realized is kinda what this note is about).

Maybe this blog will be composed entirely of posts about how there are no posts on it. Sounds like an interesting concept, and if this is what happens a few years from now, I think it'd actually be kinda proud.

Regardless, my *plan* is to indeed post about other things. I will start writing it today but won't expect to post it anytime soon.

I'm writing this note just as a way to say something else was posted in between really.

And I also updated the CSS to go for a new look. I think it has a bit more of a personality now.

Before:

After:
