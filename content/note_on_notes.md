I decided to separate the publications I'll make in my blog into two categories: *notes* and proper blog *posts*.

If you're pedantic, you're going to state that a note is something that I "post" in my "blog". We don't care about pedanticism on this website.

From a pragmatic standpoint, I just wanted to separate some writing projects from which I dedicate a lot more time and have greater length and cohesion (*a post*) from smaller pieces that might comment on specific thoughts (*a note*).

For example, if I'm developing a project and I want to post a minor update on a design decision I thought was interesting, I'll post it as a *note*. However, if I want to write up about the entire project, going from motivation to demoing a few of the implemented features, this will be a proper *post*.

A small insight into how I work: I didn't want to publish the website with zero notes or a Lorem Ipsum note, so I wrote this one instead. I showed the same lack of creativity when writing the [first post](@{base_url}/posts/gochs.html).
