I created this blog with a certain level of excitement about writing things. When I felt I had an idea or reflection I wanted to write down nicely, I didn't feel I had a place or justification for doing it. Not that I truly needed it before, but now I definitely had it!

And then, I didn't write.

*It's been 98 days since I created this blog, and there are no posts.*

I still felt like writing about certain topics occasionally, but I never got to it for two reasons.

First - not so interesting - is the *"I already have to do so many things."* While that may be true for some people, it's not for me. I routinely find myself "bored" and looking for something to do. Also, to note, I think it's healthy to *do nothing*. I do not partake in the culture of maximizing efficiency and productivity during my entire life. But to me, *intentionally doing nothing* to meditate or rest is good, whereas *doing nothing of use from inertia* is a different thing entirely, and what I find myself doing from time to time. 

**The second and more interesting reason I want to get at is that I'm afraid of writing a bad post.**

In all fairness, this is also a constant in our lives. If you're not producing bad results every now and then on something, you're either not doing enough of it or being too conservative (ps: it's okay, I'm not a doctor).

And I know this.

But still, the feeling is there, deep down, stopping me from writing stuff I want to write.

So today, I decided: **I would write a bad blog post.**

Whenever I feel like maybe what I write is not interesting, is not well formatted, is not long enough, or just doesn't contain enough original insights or takes to be worth publishing, I'll know it's at least going to be better than this.

So this is it.

Yep. This is all of it.

Just those rambling paragraphs about my own psychological struggles about writing on a blog nobody reads.

This is a bad post.

And it's a published post on the internet under my name.

And I'm happy about it.
