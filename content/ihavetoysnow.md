This weekend as a JavaScript learning exercise I wanted to replicate a tool I recently used in a hurry at work to compare two beta distributions. The idea is to add total attempts and number of conversions for two alternatives of a test and to visualize the distributions as well as compute the probability of the alternative being better than the baseline (from a Bayesian perspective). It's [here](@{base_url}/betacomparisontoy.html).

In any case, I will post later a post on my experience building it and the interesting stuff I found about JavaScript development.

This note is just as an acknowledgement that I thought it was fun to do and I plan to implement more "toys" like this, so I created a new sidebar section to include them! Check it out ðŸ‘ˆ
